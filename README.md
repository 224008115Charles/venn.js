venn.js
=======

A javascript library for laying out area proportional venn and euler diagrams.

Examples of this libray in action can be found on the [blog
post](http://www.benfrederickson.com/2013/05/09/venn-diagrams-with-d3.js.html)
I wrote about this. That blog post also contains details on the approach taken
to compute the best layout for each venn diagram.
